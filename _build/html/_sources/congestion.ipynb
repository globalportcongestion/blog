    "<!-- Our research{cite}`bai2023supply` suggests that a misunderstanding of global supply chains may have contributed to inflation forecasting errors, and related content was reported in the Wall Street Journal{cite}`wsj2023supply`. Initially, many economists dismissed the early 2021 U.S. inflation as temporary, caused by pandemic-related supply chain disruptions. However, inflation persisted, leading to a new narrative that it was driven by a tight labor market. But inflation cooled in 2023 despite low unemployment, possibly because supply chain problems lasted longer than realized. We used ACR to measure port congestion globally, showing delays increased in 2020 and remained elevated through mid-2022, explaining inflationâ€™s persistence. As ACR fell from August 2022, so did core inflation. The model proposed in this study shows that the supply-chain shock made prices unusually sensitive to changes in demand, so reining in demand can help a lot. -->"
